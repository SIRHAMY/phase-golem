- title: "Add visual separator and work item title/description to phase start logging"
  description: >
    When a new phase starts for a work item, the current log output (e.g. "Scheduling: [WRK-055 => PRD]")
    blends into the previous phase's output with no clear boundary. Two improvements needed:
    (1) Print a visual separator line above the start of each new phase so it's obvious where one phase
    ends and the next begins. (2) After the separator, print the work item ID along with its title/description
    so the user can see at a glance what the work item is about without having to open files on disk.
    For example instead of just "[WRK-055] Starting phase (PRD)" it should look something like:

    ════════════════════════════════════════
    [WRK-055] Multiple --only filters with AND logic
    Scheduling: PRD
    [WRK-055][PRD] Starting phase (non-destructive)

    The goal is that by scrolling through phase-golem output you can see what each work item is,
    what phase is being run on it, and what happened — all in one place without needing to search
    through the filesystem.
