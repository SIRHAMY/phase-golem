  status: blocked

  size: small

  requires_human_review: false
  origin: WRK-001/review
  blocked_from_status: in_progress
  blocked_reason: WRK-019 was raised from WRK-001/review suggesting blocking filesystem ops needed async wrapping. However, inspection of agent.rs shows all three filesystem operations (remove_file at line 189, read_to_string at line 337, remove_file at line 353) already use tokio::fs. Git history confirms these were async since the initial commit (02da0f6). The review finding was either a false positive or was addressed before the item was triaged. No PRD is needed because there is no work to do.

  origin: WRK-001/review
  blocked_from_status: in_progress
  blocked_reason: WRK-020 and WRK-017 both address wrapping kill_all_children in spawn_blocking for async call sites. Both originated from WRK-001 (WRK-017 from build, WRK-020 from review). WRK-017 has already been completed — it is no longer in the backlog, and its build phase produced follow-up item HAMY-119. The WRK-017 PRD explicitly documents WRK-020 as a duplicate. A separate backlog item (HAMY-118) already exists to close WRK-020 as duplicate. No PRD is needed since the work is done.

  description:
    context: The orchestrator has two modes — fully autonomous (phase-golem run) and manual status manipulation (unblock, advance). When an item is blocked by guardrails (e.g. risk exceeds max_risk), the only options are to raise the guardrail globally, manually edit the YAML to lower the assessment, or unblock and hope it doesn't re-block. There's no paved road for a human to say "I accept the risk, proceed with oversight" or "I did this work myself" or "cancel this item."
    problem: Three scenarios have no supported workflow. (1) Human-in-the-loop execution — human wants the orchestrator to run one phase at a time with explicit approval between steps, bypassing guardrails for that item. This is the primary need when an item is blocked by guardrail thresholds but the human has reviewed and accepts the risk. (2) Human-completed work — human does the work outside the orchestrator (manually writes code, runs their own build) and needs to tell the orchestrator the item is done or should skip to a later phase. Currently requires manual YAML editing. (3) Item cancellation — human decides work is no longer needed. No close/cancel command exists.
    solution: Add several CLI commands that cover these gaps. (a) phase-golem step <ID> — run exactly one phase for the item, bypassing guardrail checks, and stop. Human reviews output before running step again. Works on blocked items by implicitly unblocking them. (b) phase-golem complete <ID> — mark an item as Done (human performed the work externally). Should prompt for or accept a summary of what was done. (c) phase-golem close <ID> --reason "..." — remove item from active backlog (archive with a "closed" notation rather than "done"). (d) Consider adding --override-guardrails flag to unblock so it sets a per-item guardrail exception that persists through re-triage. All commands should commit their changes to git.
    impact: Completes the human-orchestrator interaction model. Currently the orchestrator only works well for items that fit within guardrails. This unlocks the full backlog for human-guided execution and gives humans proper off-ramps (complete externally, cancel).
    sizing_rationale: Large because it's 3-4 new CLI commands each with their own state transitions, git commits, and edge cases (e.g. step on an item mid-phase, complete an item that has in-flight work). Medium complexity because each command individually is straightforward but they need to compose well with existing status transitions and the running orchestrator. Low risk since all commands are additive and don't change autonomous behavior. High impact because it's the missing half of the orchestrator's interaction model — without it, blocked items are effectively dead ends.
