## 2026-02-19T02:37:49.555364212+00:00 — HAMY-001 (Multi-CLI Agent Support)

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Refined existing PRD through self-critique with 5 parallel agents (72 raw findings, deduplicated to ~20 themes). Applied 15 auto-fixes: added explicit AgentConfig struct requirement, model validation allowlist regex, empty-model normalization criterion, post-result validation failure behavior and location, opencode error timing at verify_cli_available, cli case sensitivity, model-on-unsupported-tool warning behavior, log format specification, handle_init TOML format, destructive/is_destructive fix elevated to Must Have, forward-extensibility notes for HAMY-001b, ambiguous pronoun fixes, and term definitions for OpenCode/Codex CLI. Status updated from Draft to Proposed.

## 2026-02-19T02:39:23.046279141+00:00 — HAMY-001 (Multi-CLI Agent Support)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Tech research already complete. Verified all findings against current codebase: CliAgentRunner unit struct (agent.rs:125), hardcoded claude invocation (agent.rs:150), verify_cli_available (agent.rs:129), two instantiation sites (main.rs:542, main.rs:703), destructive/is_destructive bug (main.rs:221-226 vs config.rs:57), PhaseResult with item_id/phase fields (types.rs:241-242). Research covers: ACP protocol discovery (emerging standard but stdin conflict for v1), OpenCode invocation pattern resolved (opencode run <prompt>), enum-based CLI dispatch recommended for v1 with ACP-ready design, prompt delivery variance (flags vs subcommands), 6 PRD concerns, 3 critical areas flagged. All research questions resolved.

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Design phase complete. Enum-based CliTool with method dispatch (build_args, binary_name, display_name), AgentConfig struct with serde defaults, parameterized CliAgentRunner, unchanged AgentRunner trait. Two alternatives evaluated (ACP-first, trait-based dispatch). Self-critique done (7 agents, 54+ findings). All directional decisions resolved. Design verified against current codebase - all assumptions confirmed.

## 2026-02-19T02:57:38.119798455+00:00 — HAMY-001 (Multi-CLI Agent Support)

- **Phase:** spec
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created implementation SPEC for multi-CLI agent support. 3 phases: (1) Config Foundation & Init Template (Medium) - CliTool enum with rename_all=lowercase, AgentConfig struct, normalization, allowlist validation, deny_unknown_fields, handle_init template fixes; (2) Agent Runner & Integration (Medium) - parameterize CliAgentRunner, reorder startup in handle_run/handle_triage, post-result validate_result_identity; (3) Observability (Low) - startup/per-phase logging, binary path resolution, doc updates. Self-critique found and fixed critical serde rename_all bug (snake_case→lowercase for OpenCode variant), upgraded model validation to full allowlist pattern per PRD, added normalization ordering constraints, DESIGN doc contradiction note for post-result validation.

## 2026-02-19T03:07:04.201225503+00:00 — HAMY-001 (Multi-CLI Agent Support)

- **Phase:** build
- **Outcome:** Subphase Complete
- **Summary:** Phase 1 (Config Foundation & Init Template) complete. Added CliTool enum (Claude, OpenCode) with build_args/binary_name/display_name/version_args/install_hint methods, AgentConfig struct with deny_unknown_fields, agent field on PhaseGolemConfig, normalize_agent_config helper, model validation with allowlist + flag-prefix rejection, serde alias for backward-compat destructive field, deny_unknown_fields on PhaseConfig, updated handle_init template with [agent] section and is_destructive field names. 66 config tests pass, all 576 project tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean.

## 2026-02-19T03:15:12.142145025+00:00 — HAMY-001 (Multi-CLI Agent Support)

- **Phase:** build
- **Outcome:** Subphase Complete
- **Summary:** Phase 2 complete: Parameterized CliAgentRunner with configurable CLI tool (CliTool enum dispatch), converted verify_cli_available to instance method, updated handle_run/handle_triage call sites with config-first ordering, added validate_result_identity() post-result validation in execute_phase, added config-to-runner integration test and 4 validation unit tests. 581 tests pass, clippy clean, fmt clean.

## 2026-02-19T03:21:46.390363919+00:00 — HAMY-001 (Multi-CLI Agent Support)

- **Phase:** build
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Phase 3 (Observability) complete: added startup logging (agent config, binary path, OpenCode experimental warning) in handle_run/handle_triage via shared log_agent_config() helper, updated verification log messages to use dynamic display_name, added per-phase CLI tool/model logging in execute_phase, updated PRD open questions and Design doc deferral notes. All 3 SPEC phases done.

- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Change review complete. All 17 PRD requirements implemented across 3 phases. 581 tests pass, no regressions. Verdict: Ready to Ship.

## 2026-02-20T02:29:44.894913900+00:00 — WRK-052 (Extract phase result builders to common if usage grows to 3+ files)

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** The 3+ file threshold is already met. PhaseResult builder helpers exist in scheduler_test, executor_test, and agent_test, with inline constructions in coordinator_test and types_test. The shared tests/common/mod.rs module already exists and is the natural home for extracted helpers. Small, low-risk refactoring of test code only.

## 2026-02-20T02:33:25.526043055+00:00 — WRK-014 (Inline trivial run_skills_sequentially passthrough function)

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for inlining trivial run_workflows_sequentially passthrough function. Function delegates directly to runner.run_agent() with no added logic, has one call site in execute_phase. PRD defines scope, success criteria (compile + test passage), and constraints (preserve tokio::select! pattern). Self-critique applied: added verification notes, clarified comment retention, specified exact inline mechanics.

## 2026-02-20T02:37:36.470630597+00:00 — WRK-014 (Inline trivial run_skills_sequentially passthrough function)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research completed. Confirmed all PRD assumptions: function is a trivial passthrough with one call site, no cancellation safety concerns with tokio::select!, LLVM already inlines at machine code level so this is purely a readability improvement. No divergences from PRD found.

## 2026-02-20T02:41:59.361084711+00:00 — WRK-014 (Inline trivial run_skills_sequentially passthrough function)

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light-mode design completed for inlining run_workflows_sequentially. Single approach: replace call with runner.run_agent() at the call site, preserve inline comment, delete function. One alternative briefly noted (keep with #[inline]) and rejected. Self-critique ran 7 agents; 2 auto-fixes applied (doc-comment deletion clarification, verification strategy detail). No critical or high issues found.
