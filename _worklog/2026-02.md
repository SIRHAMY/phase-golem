- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Tech research already complete. Verified all findings against current codebase: CliAgentRunner unit struct (agent.rs:125), hardcoded claude invocation (agent.rs:150), verify_cli_available (agent.rs:129), two instantiation sites (main.rs:542, main.rs:703), destructive/is_destructive bug (main.rs:221-226 vs config.rs:57), PhaseResult with item_id/phase fields (types.rs:241-242). Research covers: ACP protocol discovery (emerging standard but stdin conflict for v1), OpenCode invocation pattern resolved (opencode run <prompt>), enum-based CLI dispatch recommended for v1 with ACP-ready design, prompt delivery variance (flags vs subcommands), 6 PRD concerns, 3 critical areas flagged. All research questions resolved.

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Design phase complete. Enum-based CliTool with method dispatch (build_args, binary_name, display_name), AgentConfig struct with serde defaults, parameterized CliAgentRunner, unchanged AgentRunner trait. Two alternatives evaluated (ACP-first, trait-based dispatch). Self-critique done (7 agents, 54+ findings). All directional decisions resolved. Design verified against current codebase - all assumptions confirmed.

- **Phase:** spec
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created implementation SPEC for multi-CLI agent support. 3 phases: (1) Config Foundation & Init Template (Medium) - CliTool enum with rename_all=lowercase, AgentConfig struct, normalization, allowlist validation, deny_unknown_fields, handle_init template fixes; (2) Agent Runner & Integration (Medium) - parameterize CliAgentRunner, reorder startup in handle_run/handle_triage, post-result validate_result_identity; (3) Observability (Low) - startup/per-phase logging, binary path resolution, doc updates. Self-critique found and fixed critical serde rename_all bug (snake_case→lowercase for OpenCode variant), upgraded model validation to full allowlist pattern per PRD, added normalization ordering constraints, DESIGN doc contradiction note for post-result validation.

## 2026-02-20T02:29:44.894913900+00:00 — WRK-052 (Extract phase result builders to common if usage grows to 3+ files)

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** The 3+ file threshold is already met. PhaseResult builder helpers exist in scheduler_test, executor_test, and agent_test, with inline constructions in coordinator_test and types_test. The shared tests/common/mod.rs module already exists and is the natural home for extracted helpers. Small, low-risk refactoring of test code only.

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for inlining trivial run_workflows_sequentially passthrough function. Function delegates directly to runner.run_agent() with no added logic, has one call site in execute_phase. PRD defines scope, success criteria (compile + test passage), and constraints (preserve tokio::select! pattern). Self-critique applied: added verification notes, clarified comment retention, specified exact inline mechanics.

---

## 2026-02-20T02:37:36.470630597+00:00 — WRK-014 (Inline trivial run_skills_sequentially passthrough function)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research completed. Confirmed all PRD assumptions: function is a trivial passthrough with one call site, no cancellation safety concerns with tokio::select!, LLVM already inlines at machine code level so this is purely a readability improvement. No divergences from PRD found.

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light-mode design completed for inlining run_workflows_sequentially. Single approach: replace call with runner.run_agent() at the call site, preserve inline comment, delete function. One alternative briefly noted (keep with #[inline]) and rejected. Self-critique ran 7 agents; 2 auto-fixes applied (doc-comment deletion clarification, verification strategy detail). No critical or high issues found.

## 2026-02-20T03:00:47.193863720+00:00 — WRK-015 (Gate preflight Phase 3 item validation on Phase 1 structural validation passing)

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for gating preflight Phase 3 item validation on Phase 1 structural validation passing. The PRD defines the problem (Phase 3 produces confusing secondary errors when Phase 1 finds structural defects), the solution (snapshot variable gate after Phase 1, before Phase 2), scope boundaries (Phases 4/5 remain ungated), and success criteria including two specific test requirements.

## 2026-02-20T03:03:48.040569488+00:00 — WRK-015 (Gate preflight Phase 3 item validation on Phase 1 structural validation passing)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research confirmed guard clause with snapshot variable is the correct approach. PRD is precise and matches codebase reality. Exact code locations identified: snapshot goes after line 47 (Phase 1) before line 50 (Phase 2) in src/preflight.rs. Test patterns and helpers documented for the two required tests.

## 2026-02-20T03:21:07.019117417+00:00 — WRK-054 (Add --auto-advance flag for multi-target runs)

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Small, low-risk feature follow-up from WRK-030. Adds --auto-advance CLI flag so multi-target runs skip to the next target when the current one blocks, instead of halting. Existing target advancement infrastructure (advance_to_next_active_target, SchedulerState.current_target_index) can be reused directly. Changes touch main.rs (CLI arg), scheduler.rs (conditional branch at halt check), and tests.

## 2026-02-20T03:25:39.960460145+00:00 — WRK-017 (Wrap kill_all_children in spawn_blocking for async call sites)

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for wrapping kill_all_children() call sites in spawn_blocking. The change is mechanical: both async call sites in handle_run and handle_triage will use spawn_blocking to avoid blocking tokio worker threads, matching the existing kill_process_group() pattern. Self-critique applied 5 auto-fixes (explicit .await requirement, Must Have error handling pattern, WRK-020 closure action, anti-pattern consequence clarity, mutual exclusivity confirmation). Noted WRK-020 as duplicate.

---

## 2026-02-20T03:29:21.929813419+00:00 — WRK-017 (Wrap kill_all_children in spawn_blocking for async call sites)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research completed. External and internal research fully validate the PRD approach. The existing kill_process_group() pattern (agent.rs:304-333) is the exact template: spawn_blocking(|| { ... }).await.unwrap_or_else(|e| log_warn!(...)).  No concerns, no open questions, no PRD conflicts. Key external finding: tokio#7499 confirms the sync constraint is correct (spawn_blocking during shutdown may silently drop closures).

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light-mode design completed for wrapping both async call sites of kill_all_children() in spawn_blocking. Design mirrors the established kill_process_group() error handling pattern. Self-critique (7 agents) identified and auto-fixed 4 issues: panic semantics characterization, move keyword consistency, overstated mirroring claim, and runtime safety verification.

- **Phase:** review
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Change review complete. All 6/6 PRD success criteria verified in source code. Both kill_all_children() call sites correctly wrapped in spawn_blocking with unwrap_or_else + log_warn! error handling, exactly matching the established kill_process_group() pattern. No critical, high, or medium followups. One low-severity followup about auditing other blocking operations already tracked as WRK-019.

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Completed medium tech research for --auto-advance flag. External research documented 4 skip-on-failure patterns (fail-fast, continue-on-error, skip-with-checkpoint, threshold-based halt), surveyed exit code conventions across 5 tools, and identified 5 common pitfalls. Internal research mapped all integration points in scheduler.rs and main.rs. PRD assumptions validated against industry patterns — no significant divergences found. Three open questions documented for design phase (duplicate target dedup, items_blocked dedup, distinct exit codes).

- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Design complete for --auto-advance flag. Conditional branch at existing block detection site with circuit breaker reset, binary exit codes, items_blocked deduplication in build_summary(). Two alternatives evaluated (new HaltReason variant, loop restructure). Self-critique applied 6 auto-fixes: pseudocode for auto-advance branch, exit code decision matrix, items_blocked dedup decision, log format spec, duplicate target clarification, --only interaction clarification.

- **Phase:** spec
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created implementation SPEC with 2 phases: Phase 1 (core implementation: RunParams field, CLI flag, auto-advance branch, exit code logic, items_blocked dedup, test fixup) and Phase 2 (6 new tests: skip, all-blocked, single-target, circuit breaker reset, backward compat, dedup unit test). Self-critique with 6 agents identified and auto-fixed 13 issues including moving test fixup to Phase 1, specifying circuit breaker test setup, committing to unit test for dedup, documenting exit code as intentional behavior change, and adding verification for reset ordering.

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Small, low-risk enhancement to parse comma-separated values in --only filter as OR logic. Extends parse_filter() to split on commas and matches_item() to check any-of. Complements WRK-055 (AND across filters); together they enable --only impact=high,medium --only status=ready. Should be built after WRK-055 lands to avoid merge conflicts in shared code.

## 2026-02-20T15:13:31.846345770+00:00 — WRK-055 (Support multiple --only filters with AND logic)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research complete. Confirmed PRD assumptions align with codebase: --target already uses Vec<String> with ArgAction::Append (exact template for --only), matches_item() composes naturally for multi-criteria AND via .all(), and Vec<FilterCriterion> cleanly replaces Option<FilterCriterion>. Mapped all integration points across filter.rs, main.rs, and scheduler.rs. Identified two critical areas: halt condition logic update (must AND all criteria in NoMatchingItems cross-check) and duplicate field validation (tag exemption). No PRD concerns found.

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** WRK-057 adds a structured description field to the triage prompt output schema so triage agents can produce SetDescription(StructuredDescription) updates. The StructuredDescription type and SetDescription handler already exist (delivered by WRK-028); this item fills the remaining gap by updating build_triage_output_suffix() in prompt.rs to include the description sub-fields (context, problem, solution, impact, sizing_rationale) in the JSON schema template. Small, low-risk change to a single function. Duplicates WRK-060, WRK-062, WRK-068, and WRK-073 which were spawned across multiple WRK-028 phases identifying the same gap.

- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light-mode design complete for comma-separated OR values within --only filter. Key decisions: modify FilterCriterion.value to Vec<FilterValue> (Option A from tech research), extract parse_single_value() and matches_single_value() private helpers, add FilterValue::Display impl, within-list duplicate detection in parse_filter(). Self-critique ran 7 agents, applied 12 auto-fixes including: confirmed test migration scope (14 .value assertions), documented tag duplicate detection order-sensitivity as accepted limitation, added risks for comma-in-tag behavioral change and unbounded free-text value lists.

- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for adding structured description support to the triage prompt schema. The change adds a description field to PhaseResult, updates build_triage_output_suffix to include the description JSON schema, and updates apply_triage_result to call SetDescription. Self-critique with 5 parallel agents identified 50 findings; 11 auto-fixes applied covering ambiguous function references, false orchestrate-status claim, empty-description guard, struct literal breakage, commit ordering, merge edge case, inbox gap risk, and term definitions.

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research complete. All infrastructure exists from WRK-028; change is mechanical. No conflicts with PRD. Key finding: description: {} deserializes as Some(empty_struct) requiring explicit empty-check. Recommended is_empty() method on StructuredDescription. ~32 test sites need description: None added.

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for shutdown signal kill_process_group test coverage. Ran medium-mode discovery (2 agents: problem space + scope analysis) and full 5-agent self-critique. Auto-fixed 10 issues: resolved test isolation strategy (explicit reset + #[serial] escalation path), clarified kill_process_group verification approach (error message assertion sufficient), specified setter function signature, tightened vague language, resolved both open questions, and documented subprocess state expectations.

---

## 2026-02-20T19:51:59.518083230+00:00 — WRK-018 (Add test coverage for shutdown signal kill_process_group path)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research complete. Key finding: PRD's #[cfg(test)] setter approach won't work from integration tests (tests/agent_test.rs) due to Rust's compilation model — library is compiled without cfg(test) for integration test crates. Recommended approach: place test in a #[cfg(test)] mod tests {} block inside src/agent.rs (follows existing patterns in coordinator.rs, scheduler.rs, etc.). All PRD line numbers and other assumptions verified accurate.

- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light design complete for shutdown signal test. Unit test in src/agent.rs with #[cfg(test)] setter, following existing codebase patterns. Self-critique (7 agents) applied auto-fixes: PRD divergence callout, fixture path resolution, async annotation, panic-safety limitation, setter placement, and Ordering::Relaxed rationale.

- **Phase:** spec
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created SPEC with single phase: add #[cfg(test)] setter function and unit test for shutdown signal path in src/agent.rs. Self-critique (6 agents) applied auto-fixes: renamed test for accuracy, made assertion pattern explicit, added Ordering::Relaxed inline comment task, added Nice-to-Have test variant to Followups.

## 2026-02-20T20:06:50.001608344+00:00 — WRK-018 (Add test coverage for shutdown signal kill_process_group path)

- **Phase:** build
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Added #[cfg(test)] setter function and unit test for shutdown signal kill_process_group path in src/agent.rs. Test verifies run_subprocess_agent returns Err("Shutdown requested") when shutdown flag is set. All 657 tests pass, clippy clean, code review passed.

- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Change review complete. All 6 Must Have and 2 Should Have PRD criteria met. Implementation adds a #[cfg(test)] setter and one unit test in src/agent.rs that exercises the shutdown signal kill_process_group path. Test passes, clippy clean, no regressions. One low-priority followup (process group kill variant test) deferred with documented rationale.

## 2026-02-20T20:09:28.225952978+00:00 — WRK-061 (Add inbox description rendering to triage prompt)

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Small fix: pass inbox_item.description through ingest_inbox_items into BacklogItem so triage prompt renders it. The triage prompt rendering logic already exists in build_preamble(); the gap is that the description field is dropped during inbox ingestion in src/backlog.rs. Requires converting the simple String description to StructuredDescription (likely placing it in the context field).

## 2026-02-20T20:10:38.327666372+00:00 — WRK-019 (Wrap blocking filesystem ops in run_subprocess_agent with async equivalents)

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Blocked
- **Summary:** WRK-019 was raised from WRK-001/review suggesting blocking filesystem ops needed async wrapping. However, inspection of agent.rs shows all three filesystem operations (remove_file at line 189, read_to_string at line 337, remove_file at line 353) already use tokio::fs. Git history confirms these were async since the initial commit (02da0f6). The review finding was either a false positive or was addressed before the item was triaged. No PRD is needed because there is no work to do.

## 2026-02-20T20:11:22.477290121+00:00 — WRK-063 (Display impl for StructuredDescription)

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Display impl for StructuredDescription is a valid small item. The struct in src/types.rs lacks a Display impl; a render function exists in src/prompt.rs that could be replaced by a proper trait impl. WRK-069 is an exact duplicate.

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for inbox description rendering to triage prompt. The single change is mapping InboxItem.description (Option<String>) to BacklogItem.description (Option<StructuredDescription>) during ingest_inbox_items(), placing the text in the context field. Self-critique identified and auto-fixed: whitespace trimming spec, existing test update requirement, explicit test scenarios, and dependency clarification.

---

## 2026-02-20T20:19:47.226081571+00:00 — WRK-061 (Add inbox description rendering to triage prompt)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light tech research complete. Confirmed direct struct init with .filter().map() as the recommended approach for mapping InboxItem.description to StructuredDescription.context. Identified and documented: (1) parse_description() exists but is unnecessary for this simple mapping, (2) empty/whitespace filtering is critical and must use .filter() before .map(), (3) existing test at backlog_test.rs:1051 needs updating. No open questions remain.

---

## 2026-02-20T20:23:51.688931649+00:00 — WRK-061 (Add inbox description rendering to triage prompt)

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light design complete for inbox description mapping. Single-site change: add .filter().map() to convert InboxItem.description (Option<String>) to BacklogItem.description (Option<StructuredDescription>) in ingest_inbox_items(). Self-critique by 7 agents found no critical or directional issues; auto-fixed: added StructuredDescription import requirement, specific test assertions, and downstream serialization/rendering compatibility notes.

---

## 2026-02-20T20:30:03.241259450+00:00 — WRK-061 (Add inbox description rendering to triage prompt)

- **Phase:** spec
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created light-mode SPEC with single phase for mapping InboxItem.description to BacklogItem.description during ingestion. Self-critique by 6 agents found no critical or directional issues. Auto-fixed: clarified import task wording, added specific test assertions, improved verification step language, noted double-trim intent. Two low-severity items deferred to followups (integration test for prompt rendering, warning log for whitespace descriptions).

---

## 2026-02-20T20:34:14.703830929+00:00 — WRK-061 (Add inbox description rendering to triage prompt)

- **Phase:** build
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Mapped InboxItem.description to BacklogItem.description during ingestion. Added StructuredDescription field mapping with trim and empty-check filtering. Updated existing test assertion and added edge-case test covering None, empty, whitespace-only, and normal text descriptions. Also updated coordinator_test.rs assertion affected by the behavior change.

## 2026-02-20T20:37:32.213759934+00:00 — WRK-020 (Consider wrapping kill_all_children in spawn_blocking for async call sites)

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Blocked
- **Summary:** WRK-020 and WRK-017 both address wrapping kill_all_children in spawn_blocking for async call sites. Both originated from WRK-001 (WRK-017 from build, WRK-020 from review). WRK-017 has already been completed — it is no longer in the backlog, and its build phase produced follow-up item HAMY-119. The WRK-017 PRD explicitly documents WRK-020 as a duplicate. A separate backlog item (HAMY-118) already exists to close WRK-020 as duplicate. No PRD is needed since the work is done.

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Small refactor to extract the duplicated atomic write-temp-rename pattern from backlog::save, migrate_v1_to_v2, and migrate_v2_to_v3 into a shared helper. Identical 8-line block (NamedTempFile::new_in → fs::write → sync_all → persist) repeated 3 times across 2 files. Straightforward extraction, no interface changes.

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Blocked
- **Summary:** WRK-021 and WRK-018 share the exact same title and scope: 'Add test coverage for shutdown signal kill_process_group path'. WRK-018 has a complete PRD (with all open questions resolved), DESIGN, TECH_RESEARCH, and SPEC documents in its change folder. WRK-018 has progressed through build (follow-up HAMY-131 originated from WRK-018/build). No PRD is needed for WRK-021 because the work is already done under WRK-018.

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Small, low-risk refactor: change map_v2_item signature from &V2BacklogItem to V2BacklogItem for zero-cost field moves instead of cloning. Affects 1 file (migration.rs), 3 lines changed (signature + 2 call sites switching .iter() to .into_iter()). Minimal real-world impact since migration runs once per install.

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for investigating persistent data structures (im::Vector) for backlog snapshots. Framed as investigation/recommendation item with serde verification gate, alternative evaluation (snapshot caching, Arc<Vec>), and call site cataloging as must-haves. Self-critique applied: clarified persistent vs immutable terminology, added performance regression thresholds, strengthened serde as prerequisite gate, noted concurrency is non-concern due to actor model.

## 2026-02-20T20:55:43.361376292+00:00 — WRK-024 (Investigate using immutable data structures for backlog snapshots to avoid cloning)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Completed medium-depth technical research investigating persistent data structures for backlog snapshots. Cataloged 103 .items call sites across 9 files. Found that the im crate is unmaintained (imbl is the maintained fork). Actual snapshot call frequency is 2-4/tick (not 11 as PRD estimated). Recommendation: snapshot caching first (zero-cost, ~3-4x clone reduction), Arc<Vec> if measurement warrants it, imbl::Vector only at 500+ items. At current scale (5-30 items), clone cost is likely negligible (<100us/tick).

## 2026-02-20T21:03:24.052621098+00:00 — WRK-024 (Investigate using immutable data structures for backlog snapshots to avoid cloning)

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Designed snapshot caching approach for backlog snapshots. Recommends fetching one BacklogFile snapshot per scheduler tick and passing by reference to handler functions, reducing clone count from ~3-4 to 1 per tick. Explicitly defers Arc<Vec> and imbl::Vector as not cost-justified at current scale (5-30 items). Self-critique with 7 agents identified and resolved issues: added complete 13-site call catalog, fixed filter.rs integration description, added re-evaluation triggers, strengthened mutation-then-read documentation.

## 2026-02-20T21:18:49.349864180+00:00 — WRK-024 (Investigate using immutable data structures for backlog snapshots to avoid cloning)

- **Phase:** spec
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created implementation SPEC for snapshot caching optimization. Two phases: (1) pass tick snapshot to handle_promote by reference, (2) pre-fetch snapshot in handle_task_completion and share with Type A handlers. Detailed handler classification audit completed, resolving Design-deferred audit items. Self-critique with 6 agents identified and resolved issues: fixed handler type labels, added drain_join_set verification, added get_snapshot count verification, closed Design audit trail for apply_triage_result, documented wasted pre-fetch tradeoff, elevated handler test follow-up to medium priority.

## 2026-02-20T21:35:50.033232972+00:00 — WRK-074 (Close WRK-040 as duplicate of WRK-034)

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Blocked
- **Summary:** WRK-074 is a duplicate of WRK-044, which already tracks closing WRK-040 as a duplicate. Both items aim to close WRK-040; they only differ on the merge target (WRK-034 vs WRK-037). Additionally, WRK-081, WRK-084, and WRK-087 are exact duplicates of WRK-074.

## 2026-02-20T21:40:39.392372967+00:00 — WRK-025 (Clean up stale .phase-golem result files on startup and shutdown)

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for stale result file cleanup on startup and shutdown. Defined success criteria, scope boundaries, constraints, and assumptions. Self-critique applied: clarified domain terminology, specified shutdown cleanup timing relative to lock lifecycle, added directory-level error handling requirements, resolved log level ambiguity, and documented trusted-input assumption for filename patterns.

## 2026-02-20T21:44:21.033320814+00:00 — WRK-025 (Clean up stale .phase-golem result files on startup and shutdown)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light technical research completed. Confirmed PRD accuracy against codebase. Recommended hand-rolled tokio::fs::read_dir + string matching (no new dependencies). Identified precise insertion points: startup cleanup after lock acquisition (main.rs:346), shutdown cleanup after backlog commit (main.rs:721). Error handling follows existing agent.rs pattern (swallow errors, log warnings).

## 2026-02-20T21:49:46.147537147+00:00 — WRK-025 (Clean up stale .phase-golem result files on startup and shutdown)

- **Phase:** design
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Light-mode design complete for stale result file cleanup. Single async function cleanup_stale_result_files() in main.rs with two call sites: startup (Must Have, after lock acquisition) and shutdown (Should Have, after backlog commit). Uses hand-rolled tokio::fs::read_dir + string matching, error-swallowing pattern. Self-critique ran 7 agents; auto-fixed: shutdown timing precision, error handling justification, log format specs, lock scope docs, naming convention dependency note, PRD priority distinction.

## 2026-02-20T21:59:40.284441205+00:00 — WRK-025 (Clean up stale .phase-golem result files on startup and shutdown)

- **Phase:** spec
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created implementation SPEC with 1 phase: add cleanup_stale_result_files() function to main.rs with startup and shutdown call sites, plus 6 unit tests. Self-critique (6 agents) applied 16 auto-fixes including context parameter for log prefixes, corrected shutdown placement outside if/else block, additional test cases for partial failure and directory entries, and semantic anchor insertion points.

## 2026-02-20T22:04:42.061360289+00:00 — WRK-025 (Clean up stale .phase-golem result files on startup and shutdown)

- **Phase:** build
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Implemented cleanup_stale_result_files() in main.rs with startup and shutdown call sites. Added 6 unit tests covering happy path, non-matching files, missing/empty directories, partial failure recovery, and directory entries with matching names. All tests pass, clippy clean, code review passed.

- **Phase:** review
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Change review complete. All 6 PRD success criteria verified as implemented. Code follows established codebase patterns (error-swallowing cleanup from agent.rs, async read_dir from executor.rs). 6 unit tests cover all specified scenarios. Startup call site is after lock acquisition, before agents. Shutdown call site is outside coord_task if/else, before summary. Both execute under lock. Tests pass, clippy clean.

## 2026-02-20T22:08:10.789799001+00:00 — WRK-075 (Auto re-triage stale pre-phase items after configurable idle period)

- **Phase:** triage
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Medium-sized feature requiring new phase-entry timestamps, config fields, and scheduler idle detection logic. WRK-076 is an exact duplicate. Created idea file for human review due to design decisions around re-triage semantics.

- **Phase:** prd
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Created PRD for next_item_id validation warning on BACKLOG.yaml load. Ran 5-agent self-critique, applied 7 auto-fixes including: added terminology section, concrete warning message format, clarified prefix handling strategy (load_config with graceful fallback), empty backlog edge case, promoted file path to Must Have, and resolved Risks/Assumptions contradiction.

## 2026-02-20T22:16:54.362029013+00:00 — WRK-031 (Add validation warning when next_item_id < max(current items) on BACKLOG.yaml load)

- **Phase:** tech-research
- **Outcome:** Complete
- **Summary:** Completed light tech research for next_item_id validation warning. Confirmed inline post-deserialization validation is the standard Rust pattern. Identified all reusable codebase components (ID parsing logic in generate_next_id, log_warn! macro, load_config). Discovered critical design consideration: load() has two return paths (migration and direct v3 load) that both need validation coverage. Recommended extracting a validation helper function.
